<h2>GitHub</h2>
We maintain our online presence on GitHub. GitHub is a service of GitHub, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, CA 95833-3505, USA, a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.
We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United States. This may increase risks for users that, for example, may make subsequent access to the user data more difficult. We also do not have access to this user data. Access is only available to GitHub.
GitHub collects and stores access logs. This data is not accessible to us.
