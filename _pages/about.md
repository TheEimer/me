<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a researcher at the Leibniz University of Hannover currently working towards my PhD. I focus on making Reinforcement Learning agents more general by dynamically adapting their behavior. I'm interested in all things AutoRL, especially dynamic algorithm configuration for RL and curriculum learning, as well as generalization in RL.

I completed my masterâ€™s degree in computer science in 2019 at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter. Since 2020, I've been a PhD candidate in Hannover supervised by Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer. I have interned at MetaAI in London in 2022/23. If you ever want to have a chat (about research or otherwise), feel free to book a slot in my [office hour](https://calendar.app.google/tMdop6qyU59B1XF5A)!
