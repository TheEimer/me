<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a researcher at the Leibniz University of Hannover currently working towards my PhD. I focus on making Reinforcement Learning agents more general by dynamically adapting their behavior.
I completed my masterâ€™s degree in computer science in 2019 at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter. Since 2020, I've been a PhD candidate in Hannover supervised by Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer. I have previously interned at MetaAI in London.
